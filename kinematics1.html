                <h1 class="main-page-title">Kinematics-1</h1>
                <p>Kinematics. What does it mean? Will I teach you how to fix cars and machines and stuff? No, not at all. We worry about the big things here. Moving bodies. You walk, I walk. You run, I run. A car moves and so does an airplane. Even atoms and molecules move. They move fast; not your average kind of fast but incredibly fast. Incredibly fast! So, in physics, kinematics deals with the analysis of motion. Truthfully, physicists don't like leaving a single stone unturned. So, have we analyzed every kind of motion there exists; the motion of every object in the universe? (*chuckle*) Not at all! How much do we know then? Much more than you could ever study in your life. So, we are going to be learning about how things move. We'll take a step into the real world and finally, for probably the first time in your life, you'll know how things work.</p>
    
                <p>We will be taking a long and interesting journey throughout the cosmos and the world too. You may think that you understand what motion is. However, the more you learn the less you know. Each body moves in a different way than the other. Learning about the motion of bodies is interesting. Some move fast and some move slow. Some move in a circular path, while some don't.</p> 
            </div>

            <hr width="92%" class="hr">

            <div class="section-t">
                <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;">What is Motion?</h1>
                <p>Many of you may know what motion is. Consider a notebook lying on the table. You say it isn't moving. Right? But consider the earth. It rotates and revolves around the sun. The notebook being here on earth also rotates and moves around the sun right? Why does it look like it's at rest i.e. not moving when we look at it on our table but seems to be moving when we look at it from space. Suppose two friends carry out an experiment. One sits in a car driving down the road while one stands on the sidewalk. Let's call the person in the car Alice and the other one, Bob. Classic example. Alice looks out the window and what does she see? She sees Bob moving down the road, the trees and pavement, everything moving down the road. And what does Bob see? He sees Alice in the car, drifting away. To Alice, she is not moving with respect to everything within the car and she thinks that the road outside itself is moving and she's not actually wrong. Now we, being intelligent creatures, do know that it is the car that is moving and not the road and the trees. But Alice wouldn't know any better if she didn't feel the motion of the car. She would definitely think that the trees and the sidewalk is moving backward.</p>
                <p>So how do we know if there is movement or not? How do we know what is moving when we don't have something to compare its motion to? In the example of Alice and Bob, Alice compares Bob's movement with respect to the her own perception of the surrounding around the sidewalk and Bob compares Alice's motion with the road, the trees and perception of the surroundings. Both have a different point-of-view, so to say. They compare each other's movements from a different <i><b>"frame"</b></i>. So both of them are absolutely right, in their own way.</p>
    
    
                <h1><i>Alice and Bob</i></h1>
                <p>Have we reached a conclusion? Physicists use the concept of something called <b><i>reference-frames</i></b> to resolve the problem that Alice and Bob are facing. You can think of it as the background or the frame against which motion is judged. It's all about what you use to compare your motion against. If you put yourself in a totally dark room, with no sensation of gravity or which way is down and which way up, then you won't be able to tell whether a ball moving in the room is moving to the left, the right or if it's moving at all. In the case of Alice, who is in the car, she can consider two reference-frames; one inside the car and one outside the car. She is at rest with respect to the objects inside the car and concludes that the reference-frame for Bob itself is moving. The trees, the pavement and the whole sidewalk. So even reference-frames can move. How do we judge if a reference-frame is moving. Put it in a reference-frame that is not moving. There. Problem solved! But, how do we know that this other reference-frame is moving or not? That's the dilemma! We could consider something like the universe to be an <i><b>inertial reference-frame</b></i> i.e., a reference frame that is not moving. Why? Because that is the only thing we can see all around us. We can't know with absolute certainty whether the universe is moving itself or not. We can't see anything beyond the universe, having something to compare it to.</p>
                <p>So you now know one of the most important parameters that is used to define motion and understand it! Many of you are probably already questioning your existence too. <i>'Can you believe in what you see?'</i></p>

            <hr width="92%" class="hr">

            <div class="section-i">
                <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Motion</h1>
                <p>Many of you probably already know what speed and distance and velocity is. But why do you need to understand it? Why do you even need it? Does it have anything to unravel the deepest mysteries of the universe? Well, kind of. These quantities provide a quantitative measure of motion. Quantitative? It helps assign a <i><b>'number'</b></i> so to say, to motion, that helps us understand it better. You'll be seeing this soon enough, where and how it is so important. Understanding the concepts of speed and distance will bring you one step closer to understanding the world around. It might not have so much of an importance in itself, but is quintessential in understanding other topics in physics.</p>


                <h1><i>Distance</i></h1>
                <p>Say you travel from some point \(A\) to some point \(B\). The total length of the path you took to reach there is the distance. It is the path length you travel. That's it. Simple and concise. </p>


                <h1><i>Displacement</i></h1>
                <p>Many people don't understand the difference between distance and displacement at times. Many of you must've already come across this word before. Remember the path you took from \(A\) to \(B\)? Well, a straight line joining \(A\) and \(B\) would have been faster, wouldn't it? This is called the <i><b>displacement</b></i>. It is the shortest distance between the initial and final points of your journey. Here's a figure to help you understand this concept better.</p>

                <div class="section-i-image">
                    <img src="kinematics1.1.svg" alt="ERROR! Can't load image">
                </div>

                <p>Suppose you go from \(A\) to \(B\) on a path outlined by the solid line. The dotted line represents the shortest direct distance between \(A\) and \(B\). So here you see how the distance travelled is much larger than the displacement. The straight dotted line \(AB\) is the displacement of the body.</p>



                <h1><i>Speed</i></h1>
                <p>Imagine two cars going from \(A\) to \(B\). The one that takes less time to reach there is faster right? But what if they took different paths but reached at the same time? Simple enough. The one that travelled a longer distance in a set amount of time must be faster, right? Now what if both travel and different paths, taking a different route and taking different times to reach there. <i><b>Speed</b></i> helps tell us which of the two was faster. It is the <i><b>distance travelled</b></i> over a <i><b>period </b></i>or rather, <i><b>unit of time</b></i>. It is the <i><b>rate of change of distance</b></i>, i.e. how much distance you travel in a unit of time, say 1 second or 1 hour. Speed has units of distance divided by time. So, \(m\;s^{-1}\) (i.e. \(m/s\)) or \(km\;hr^{-1}\) are units of speed. For all the Americans out there, \(mph\) or <i><b>miles per hour</b></i> is a unit of speed too.
                    
                $$speed=\frac{distance\;travelled}{time\;taken}$$
                </p>

                <p>What's the <i><b>velocity</b></i> then? It's the <i><b>displacement over time</b></i>. It is said to be the <i><b>rate of change of displacement</b></i>. We'll be coming across many instances of why velocity is so much more useful than speed.</p>

                <p>All these quantities provide a quantitative measure of motion. They define motion in a detailed manner.</p>
            </div>

            <hr width="92%" class="hr">

            <div class="section-t">
                <h1>AVERAGE <i>and</i> SPEED</h1>
                <p>There could be two scenarios throughout your journey; one where you move at a constant speed. Thus, covering equal amounts of distance in equal units of time. Say you cover 1 km each minute. You'll be covering 60 km per hour. Thus, your speed becomes \(60\;km\;hr^{-1}\) or \(60\;km/hr\).</p>
                <p>Now what if the distances you cover in equal intervals of time is not the same. Say you cover 1 km the 1<sup>st</sup> minute, 1.25 km the next minute and 1.5 km in the 3<sup>rd</sup>. What kind of a speed would you choose to define the whole journey? You could find the speed in the first and second and third minute, sum it up and find the average speed. That's it. That's what the average speed is. Since the time intervals are equal, if we let each time interval be equal to \(t\) and the distance covered in each minute be \(d_1\), \(d_2\) and so on, we get the following equation for the average speed:
                
                $$avg.\;speed=\frac{\frac{d_1}{t}+\frac{d_2}{t}+\frac{d_3}{t}...}{n}$$ 
    
                where \(n\) is the number of time intervals. This is nothing but the average of the speeds in each minute. In out case above, our journey was divided into 3 equal time intervals of 1 minute each. So our average speed is:
    
                $$=\frac{1+1.25+1.5}{3}\;km/min$$
                $$=1.25\;km/min$$
    
                You see how if we have equal intervals of one unit each, we just have to add them up and not worry about the \(n\) in our previous equation? Well, that brings us to a simpler equation for average speed:
    
                $$avg.\;speed=\frac{d_1+d_2+d_3}{t+t+t}$$
                or, we can generalise it further as:
                $$avg.\;speed=\frac{total\;distance\;travelled}{net\;total\;time}$$            
            </p>
            </div>

            <hr width="92%" class="hr">

            <div class="section-t">
                <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Average Velocity</h1>
                <p>Similarly, the average velocity is the <i><b>net displacement of a body </b></i>over <i><b>total time taken</b></i>. <i><b>For a body moving forward in a straight line think about how average speed and average velocity will be the same.</b></i>
                So basically:
                $$avg.\;velocity=\frac{net\;displacement}{total\;time\;taken}$$
                
                And I believe that's it for today. To many, this might've been a new thing. You could revise the formulae and the definitions yet once more. To those who had a revision and already knew all this, try moving on to <a href="kinematics2.html">Kinematics-2</a>. Before that-
                </p>
    
                <h1><i>A note on some symbols!</i></h1>
                <p>Throughout the website, It'll be hard for me to write out the word velocity every time we want to say that or the distance or displacement for that matter. In that case, we'll be using symbols to tell them apart. Speed and distance usually don't have a symbol,  unfortunately, but velocity is denoted by a \(v\) and displacement by an \(s\). You'll see displacement written out so as to represent a change in position as well, because that's what it is, isn't it? If you go on a straight line from point marked \(x_1\) to point \(x_2\), then your displacement is nothing but the change in this position i.e. \(x_2-x_1\). So in other words, \(s=x_2-x_1\).</p>
