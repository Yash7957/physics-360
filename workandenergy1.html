                <h1 class="main-page-title">Work & Energy-1</h1>
                <p>Work, we all do work. One goes to school - does work. One goes to the office - does work. You're probably studying right now... work. But what exactly is work? In physics, we often tend to give at least a qualitative, if not, a quantitative measure of stuff - stuff like phenomena of motion or rotation for the matter. Work, similarly could be said to be <b><i>a measure of the energy of the body. </i></b>A very laymen language, but we'll get into specifics later. If you don't yet know trigonometry well, I recommend checking this site out - <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry" target="_blank">www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry</a></p>
                <p><b><i>An aside: Throughout this module, I use the word 'object' a lot. Most of the times I write 'object', I also mean a body or a system for that matter. (Go <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/momentum/Lesson-2/Isolated-Systems" target="_blank">check out what systems are</a> if you haven't already.)</i></b></p>

                <h1><i>So what is work?</i></h1>
                <p>Work, in better words, is actually a measure of the amount of energy transferred to or from a body (or system). A body can only do work if it possesses some form of energy. Work may better be defined with the following formula:
                    $$W=\vec F \cdot \vec d$$
                    $$or, W=Fd\cos \theta$$
                where, \(\theta\) is the angle between the force and the quantity \(d\) that stands for the displacement that the force causes. (<b>and not the distance!</b>) In other words, if a force causes a body to be displaced, work is said to be done on the body. Work, unlike many quantities we've learnt about till now, is a scalar quantity. That's why we take the <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html">dot product</a> between the force and displacement, so to find the component of force along the displacement.
                </p>

                <h1><i>Work done on an object vs. by an object</i></h1>
                <p>An object can both do work or can have work done on it. In both the cases, the body will either gain or lose energy. For example, take a vertically launched projectile. You do some work on the object since you give it an upward velocity (The ball is initially at rest. You've accelerated it from rest, though in a very small amount of time.) However, after the ball leaves your hand, only gravity acts on the ball, causing it to slow down. Since it slows down, the force must be in the opposite direction of the displacement, (which we know it is since gravity always acts towards the center of the earth.) Therefore, gravity must be doing negative work (Also since the angle between the force and displacement vectors is 180째 and \(\cos 180째=-1\).)</p>
                <p>But if you consider the latter half of the journey, where the ball's coming back, both the force and displacement vectors for the ball are in the same direction and therefore, the work done by gravity must be positive (which is why the ball speeds up as well).</p>

            <div class="section-t">
                <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Energy</h1>
                <p>Energy of a body can be in many forms - kinetic, potential, chemical or light or even heat (thermal), but it is said to be the ability to do work. A body can only do work if it possesses some sort of energy. Work done on an object or by an object causes them to gain or lose some sort of energy. If we take energy considerations into account, we actually tend to make our job, generally speaking, a whole lot easier. We'll come to this in a few sections.</p>

                <h1><i>The Work-Energy Theorem</i></h1>
                <p>One intrinsic property of any moving body is that possesses <b><i>Kinetic Energy</i></b>. The body will lose this kinetic energy if negative work is done on the body or will gain more kinetic energy if positive work is done on it. The kinetic energy of any moving body is given by-
                $$KE\;(or\;E_K)=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
                where the symbols have their usual meanings. Now, if a force acts on a body to displace it, work must be done on it, we've just learnt that. Assume that the force and displacement are in the same direction. Therefore, 
                $$W=Fd$$
                $$\implies W=(ma)d$$
                $$\implies W=m(\frac{v^2-v_0^2}{2d})d$$
                $$or, W=\frac{1}{2}m(v^2-v_0^2)$$
                and this is nothing but the change in kinetic energy of the body. Thus, the work done on a body is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the body, i.e.
                $$W=\Delta KE$$
                From this you can see that if negative work is done on a body, it loses kinetic energy and thus it slows down. This makes sense because if a force is applied opposite the direction of motion, the body will slow down.
