                <p>We continue our discussion on work and energy here. This time we'll discuss about different types of potential energies. Potential energy is the energy a body possesses due to its orientation and/or position. There are different kinds of potential energies <b><i>Elastic Potential</i></b> and <b><i>Gravitational potential</i></b> energies are what we'll be discussing this time.</p>

                <h1><i>Hooke's law</i></h1>
                <p>Springs. Springs. Springs. I don't know about you but I haven't seen a lot of springs. We simply are nonchalant to how important springs are - from pens to trampolines and lawn-movers to other mechanical tools. It is fun to learn about springs and helps you gain an appreciation to learn about mechanical structure of materials. So springs. You compress a block on a spring - it wants to come back. You stretch a spring, it wants to go back again - back from where it started. This starting point of a spring is called its 'equilibrium position'. Now, it is intuitive to know that because the spring always wants to go to its equilibrium position, there must be a force that wants to drive it back. This force is always restorative in nature. The English polymath <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> is credited with the discovery of the law stating a quantitative argument of this restorative force. He noticed that this restorative force isn't constant. Why?</p>
                <p>You see, if you attach a block to a spring, what do you notice. Here's a site that might help you visualise this situation better- <a target="_blank" href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/masses-and-springs-basics/latest/masses-and-springs-basics_en.html">Masses and Springs</a>. In the simulation, if you slow it down, you see how the block changes its direction after a certain point at the top and bottom of what we call an "oscillation" (more on this later). What's basically happening is that this restorative force which the spring exerts on the block wants to drive it back to equilibrium. However, at the equilibrium, the block tends to have some velocity left, so it continues its motion till it reaches one of its extreme positions. It stops at these positions momentarily and the moves to the equilibrium position again... and repeat. The body slows down, which means there must be an acceleration. This acceleration however, is not constant and with these arguments, Hooke gave his law, stating that the restorative force will be proportional to the displacement of the block from equilibrium. In other words, 
                
                $$F_s=k|x|$$

                This gives us the magnitude of the restorative spring force. The direction depends on which side of the equilibrium position the block will be on. We can assume the equilibrium position to be 0. If the left of 0 is negative, then whenever the block is on the negative side, the force will point in the positive direction. Hooke's law is more generally written as-
                
                $$F_s=-kx$$

                \(k\) is known as the spring constant of whatever spring we're dealing with. It is the amount of force required to stretch a spring by a unit distance. It has units of \(N/m\)
                </p>

                <p>Now, at an extreme position, (this maximum displacement from the equilibrium is known as the <b><i>Amplitude of oscillation</i></b>) the spring comes to a stop momentarily. (The change in the direction of motion is almost instantaneous) At the equilibrium, the velocity is the highest. Work must have been done throughout this journey, from the extreme position to equilibrium since the kinetic energy of the block changed. Before we understand Elastic Potential, first let's understand about the law of conservation of energy.</p>

            <div class="section-t">
                <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Conservation of energy</h1>
                <p>The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system in the absence of any external forces is always conserved. You know what systems are. If there are forces outside that system - they are external. External forces can do work on a system (internal forces cannot) and thus change the total energy of the system. (Any object can be considered a system as well since it comprises of many different kinds of molecules). For many of our real-world cases, it is useful to define mechanical energy. It is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies of the body. Think about a freely falling ball. I say that in the absence of external forces, energy is conserved. But the ball seems to gain kinetic energy when it reaches the ground. So there was some sort of energy when it started falling - this was gravitational potential energy. Similarly, in our block and spring example, the block gained elastic potential energy when it was stretched (or even compressed) before being left to oscillate. But how exactly?</p>

                <h1><i>Back to elastic potential energy</i></h1>
                <p>So when the block is stretched (or compressed), one works against the restorative spring force and by stretching (or compressing) the spring, your muscles do work on the mass and end up helping it gain elastic potential energy. How much energy does the block gain? Well, we can use an integral to find that out. If you don't yet know much about integrals, <a target="_blank" href="https://math.mit.edu/~djk/calculus_beginners/">check this webpage out</a>. We know that the force isn't constant. You must do work against this force to stretch the spring. (or compress it) The force is a function of the stretch or compression. We integrate as follows: (say I stretch the spring - it doesn't matter if I stretch or compress it by the same amount, it'll end up gaining the same potential energy as long as the displacement from equilibrium is the same)
                $$\int_0^A -\vec F(x) dx$$
                where \(A\) is the amplitude of oscillation (and \(-F\) since you work against the spring force)
                $$\therefore\;U_s=\int_0^A \vec F(x)dx=\int_0^A -(-kx)dx$$
                $$=k\int_0^A xdx$$
                $$=\frac{1}{2}kA^2$$

                Using this, you can now calculate the maximum speed during oscillation in terms of the spring constant, mass of the block and amplitude of oscillation - stuff that'll be easy to measure. Try to calculate it. You should get that the maximum velocity (ignoring any sort of resistive frictional or drag forces) is \(v=A\sqrt{k/m}\)

            <div class="section-t">
                <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Gravitational Potential Energy</h1>
                <p>First of all, we know from the conservation of energy that the mechanical energy of a body is conserved. The mechanical energy of a body is given as:
                    $$E_{mech}=KE+U_g+U_s$$ 
                where \(KE\) is the kinetic energy, \(U_g\) the gravitational potential energy and \(U_s\) the elastic potential energy. In our previous example of masses and springs, we didn't consider any \(U_g\) and in most cases of gravitation potential energy, we won't have any \(U_s\) involved. However, some complicated configurations can have both, elastic and gravitational potential. We won't be dealing with them at the moment. Let's just ignore one of the potential energies, i.e. elastic potential for now. Think about a falling ball. If you look just at the ball, it gains speed as it accelerates towards the ground. What about conservation of energy? Well, for that we must consider a system. The system of only the ball itself is not isolated - the gravitational pull of the earth acts as an external force. You'll see however, that the energy of the earth-ball system will remain constant. In this system, the forces will be internal. So the mechanical energy of the ball must remain constant within this isolated system. But work is done on the ball nevertheless, since it gains a velocity. This means it must lose energy in some other form to obey the conservation law. (Energy in our universe can only change from one form to another. Otherwise, the science can get pretty weird. Where would this new 'energy' even come from? Think about it, all forms of energy you see and just some form of energy being converted into other types.)</p>
                <p>The ball at the top of the journey possesses gravitational potential energy. However, looking only at the ball, work is done on it since it gains kinetic energy. But it must also lose gravitational potential energy. Therefore, we can say
                    $$KE_i+U_i=KE_f+U_f$$
                    $$\implies KE_f-KE_i=-(U_f-U_i)$$
                    $$or,\;\Delta KE=-\Delta U$$ 
                    $$\implies W=-\Delta U$$
                We're now going to use this result to find out the gravitational potential energy of a body. GPE can only exist between two bodies with mass since it is a result between the interaction of a body and a gravitational field. We'll define this GPE in terms of the work done. We know from newton's law of gravitation that the gravitational force (and thus GPE) will also be a function of the distance between the bodies. Let's take a planet and a body and assume that \(U_g(\infty )=0\). We work against gravity to start and end a body at rest from \(\infty \) to a distance \(x\) from the planet. The work that I have to do, and I do have to do work against gravity will be:
                    $$W=\int_r^\infty \vec F(x) \cdot d\vec x$$
                    $$i.e.\; \Delta U= -\int_x^\infty \vec F(x) \cdot d\vec x$$
                    $$\implies \Delta U= -\int_x^\infty \frac{GMm}{x^2} \cdot d\vec x$$
                    $$\implies \Delta U= -\int_x^\infty GMm {[\frac{-1}{x}]}_x^\infty$$
                    $$or\;\Delta U=-\frac{GMm}{x}$$ 
                However, for objects that are near earth, the force can be considered constant (since the \(x\) term is not changing) and therefore we need not set up an integral as before. We can say:
                    $$\Delta U=-\int_{y_i}^{y_f}(-mg)dy$$
                which yields,
                    $$\Delta U=mg\Delta y$$
